# Healthcare Claims Processing System

A comprehensive React-based healthcare claims management and processing simulator built with modern web technologies and integrated with Supabase for backend functionality.

## üè• Project Overview

This application simulates a healthcare claims processing system with three distinct scenarios that demonstrate common challenges in medical billing and claims adjudication. The system allows users to search claims, view detailed claim information, validate member data, and process claims according to different business rules.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Claims Search & Management**: Search claims by Claim Number (Document Control Number) and view comprehensive claim details
- **Scenario-Based Processing**: Three distinct scenarios simulating real-world claims processing challenges
- **Member Information Management**: Search and validate member demographics and contract information
- **Provider Information Display**: Comprehensive provider details and network participation
- **Payment Information**: Detailed breakdown of claim costs, deductibles, copays, and payment amounts
- **Interactive Claim Lines**: View and edit procedure codes, modifiers, and service details
- **Real-time Validation**: Dynamic validation of member data against claim forms
- **Contract Management**: Apply different contracts and validate service date eligibility

## üìã The Three Scenarios

### Scenario 507 - Patient Information Mismatch (Claim Number: 25048AA1000)
**Challenge**: Member demographics in the system don't match the claim form data
- **Edit Code**: 507 - "Patient information mismatch - verify member demographics"
- **Validation**: System validates patient name, DOB, and subscriber ID against claim form
- **Expected Action**: PAY (after correcting member information)
- **Learning Objective**: Importance of accurate member data validation

### Scenario 509 - Contract Group Validation (Claim Number: 25048AA1001)
**Challenge**: Contract group validation required - verify active eligibility
- **Edit Code**: 509 - "Contract group validation required - verify active eligibility"
- **Validation**: Service date must fall within contract effective period for correct group
- **Expected Action**: PAY (after applying correct group "200000M001")
- **Learning Objective**: Understanding contract periods and group eligibility

### Scenario 597 - Service Date Outside Contract Period (Claim Number: 25048AA1002)
**Challenge**: No active eligibility for service dates
- **Edit Code**: 597 - "No active eligibility for service dates - service date outside contract period"
- **Validation**: Service date falls outside member's contract effective period
- **Expected Action**: DENY (service not covered due to no active eligibility)
- **Learning Objective**: Managing claims when services occur outside coverage periods

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd healthcare-claims-system

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server

```

### Environment Setup
The application connects to Supabase using the following configuration:
- **Supabase URL**: https://skkfbhktfscvvxangkoh.supabase.co
- **Anon Key**: Pre-configured in the client

## üì± Application Flow

### 1. Getting Started Page
- Landing page with introduction to the claims processing system
- Navigation to search functionality

### 2. Search Claims Page
- Search interface for finding claims by Claim Number
- Results table showing claim summary information
- Direct navigation to claim details

### 3. Claim Details Page
- Comprehensive claim information display
- Tabbed interface with multiple sections:
  - **Event Resolution**: Edit codes, status, and action buttons
  - **Member Information**: Demographics and contract details
  - **Provider Information**: Healthcare provider details
  - **Payment Information**: Financial breakdown
  - **Claim Header**: Service dates and benefit indicators
  - **Claim Lines**: Procedure codes and service details
  - **Claim Data**: Raw claim processing data
  - **Search Tabs**: Claim image, member search, and pricing

### 4. Interactive Features

## üîí Security Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Enabled on all Supabase tables
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schema validation for all forms
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Supabase client

## üéì Learning Objectives

This application teaches:
1. **Claims Processing Workflow**: Understanding the complete lifecycle of healthcare claims
2. **Data Validation**: Importance of accurate member information and eligibility verification
3. **Contract Management**: How coverage periods and group contracts affect claim processing
4. **Edit Code Resolution**: Common claim edit scenarios and their resolution strategies
5. **Healthcare Industry Standards**: Exposure to real-world healthcare data structures and terminology

## üîÑ Business Logic

### Scenario Validation Logic
Each scenario implements specific business rules:

**Scenario 507**: Validates patient demographics match between claim form and member record
**Scenario 509**: Ensures service dates fall within active contract periods
**Scenario 597**: Identifies claims with services outside coverage periods

### Data Relationships
- Claims connect to members through subscriber ID and demographics
- Claim lines link to main claims for service detail
- Providers connect through NPI numbers
- Contract validation uses effective/end dates

## üìä Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load data only when needed
- **Query Optimization**: Efficient Supabase queries with proper indexing
- **State Management**: React Query for caching and synchronization
- **Bundle Optimization**: Tree-shaking and code splitting with Vite

## ü§ù Contributing

When contributing to this project:
1. Follow the established TypeScript patterns
2. Use the design system tokens for all styling
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Write comprehensive tests for new scenarios
5. Document any new business rules or validation logic

## üìû Support
